## Hi there 👋

**FreddieBeasley/FreddieBeasley** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **blockchain-based voting systems**, **pathfinding algorithms**, and **physics simulations** to explore innovative solutions in software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about **distributed systems** and **algorithm optimization** to enhance my technical skills.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects** related to blockchain, AI, or simulation-based applications.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **scaling decentralized systems** and optimizing complex algorithms.
- 💬 Ask me about **Java**, **Python**, or my projects on blockchain and pathfinding!
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freddie-beasley-056b59239/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about blending technology with real-world impact to solve solutions to everyday problems - whether that be online voting, physics simulations or software applications.
